Styling and Design
The game should have an engaging and user-friendly interface.
Buttons should be large and easy to click.
Use contrasting colors to differentiate between the target color and the options.
Use CSS for animations when showing game results (e.g., fade-out effect for wrong answers or celebration for correct ones).
The design must be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Functionality
Randomly select a color from a predefined set and display it as the target color.
Implement the functionality for the player to click on the color buttons and check if they guessed correctly.
